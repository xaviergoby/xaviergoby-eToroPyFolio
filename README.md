#### <span style="color:#B22222">Note</span>

- This is an "**unofficial**" [<span style="color:#228B22">eToro</span>](https://www.etoro.com/) portfolio data analysis package.
- This package has no relation, affiliation, or what not, with the Quantopian package, [pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio).
- All variables which explicitly referring to those visible on the website are expressed between double quotation marks, " ", e.g. "Avg Open", **within this Markdown README documentation file**. On
  the other hand, **within the source code**, single quotation marks, ' ', are used instead, e.g. 'Avg Open'.
- A number of abbreviations/acronyms are used within project, such as `BRE` for `"Beginning Realized Equity"`
  <details>	
  <summary>Expand to see a more complete list of these.</summary>
  - `WD`:= `"Withdrawals"`		
  - `WDF`:= `"Withdrawal Fees"`		
  - `ROF`:= `"Roll Over Fees"`
  - `TPL`:= `"Trade Profit or Loss"`
  - `BRE`:= `"Beginning Realized Equity"`
  - `ERE`:= `"Ending Realized Equity"`
  </details>
- Any data/information unavailable in the xlsx account statement is derived/inferred. Therefore, discrepancies between the values of some variables is to be expected! 
  <details>    
  <summary>Expand to see  examples of data unavailable</summary>
  in the xlsx account statement which are approximated are:
  - "Avg Open" price of open orders. The "Avg Open" is approximated as `"Avg Open" = (Close + Open) รท 2` where the `Close` and `Open` values used are the open and close prices obtained
    using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) for the date the order was opened.
  - "Units" of open orders. Derived by `"Units" = "Amount" รท "Avg Open"`
  - "Profit" of open orders (as all "Profit" price values absent in the xlsx account statement file). Approximation via `"Profit" = ("Avg Open" - Close) x "Units"` where the `Close` price value used
    is that of the previous trading days close price.
  </details>	  
- I take **NO** no <ins>credit</ins>, nor <ins>responsibility</ins>, positive or negative, for any and all suggestion or allegement made towards or against this package.

## <span style="color:#228B22">eToroPyfolio</span> Developpement  Motivatrion & Reasons


### The **Egregious** & **Shamefull** [<span style="color:#228B22">eToro</span>](https://www.etoro.com/) "Account Statement" XLSX File:

"Egregious"? "Shameful"? Absolutely! Let's have a look at why this is. Pick a row in the "Closed Positions" sheet of the "Account Statement" XLSX file. Notice that the date & time format employed
by [<span style="color:#228B22">eToro</span>](https://www.etoro.com/) in both columns "Open Date" & "Close Date" is:

"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 16/06/2020 13:30

Now, if you have a look at the date & time format employed in the "Transactions Report" sheet,

Now, if you have a look at the date & time format employed in the "Date" column of the "Transactions Report" sheet, you'll see [<span style="color:#228B22">eToro</span>](https://www.etoro.com/)
employing the following format:

"%Y-%d-%m %H:%M:%S", e.g. 2020-06-16 13:30:05

So yeah, what is this nonsensical difference and inconsistency? Why can't the date & time formatting employed be consistent? Why must finding the transaction information associated with a certain
closed order require the additional effort of wrangling and remembering the different date & time formatting conventions employed?

Now, have a look at the date and time format employed in the "Account Details" sheet. Here, we have:

"%-m/%-d/%Y %-I:%M:%S %p", e.g. 12/20/2020 7:02:01 PM

It is, literally, as if the "Closed Positions" sheet had been filled in by
a [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_Europe#:~:text=Official%20EU%20documents%20still%20tend,YYYY%2DMM%2DDD.%22), the "Transactions Report" sheet by
a [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_Japan#:~:text=The%20most%20commonly%20used%20date,%22Wednesday%2031%20December%202008%22.) and the "Account Details" sheet by
an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States).




#### <span style="color:#228B22">eToro</span> Date & Time Format**s**:

- Account Details (US DT Format):
    - Date Created: "%-m/%-d/%Y %-I:%M:%S %p", e.g. 12/20/2020 7:02:01 PM
    - Start Date: "%-m/%-d/%Y %-I:%M:%S %p", e.g. 1/1/2020 12:00:00 AM
    - End Date: "%-m/%-d/%Y %-I:%M:%S %p", e.g. 12/19/2020 11:59:59 PM
- Closed Positions (EU DT Format):
    - Open Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 16/06/2020 13:30
    - Close Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 06/07/2020 16:25
- Transactions Report (Jap DT Format):
    - Date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", e.g. 2020-06-16 13:30:05

#### <span style="color:#228B22">eToroPyfolio</span> Date & Time Format **Convention**:

The general guideline is to follow
the [European date & time notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_Europe#:~:text=Official%20EU%20documents%20still%20tend,YYYY%2DMM%2DDD.%22) and completely disregard
anything to do wih seconds.

- Account Details:
    - Date Created: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 20/12/2020 19:02
    - Start Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 01/01/2020 00:00
    - End Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 19/12/2020 23:59
- Closed Positions: <- *Unchanged*
    - Open Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 20/08/2020 14:30
    - Close Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 14/12/2020 14:31
- Transactions Report:
    - Date: "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M", e.g. 2020-05-26 22:47

Why disregard seconds, you may be ask? Well... are you a High Frequency Trader (HFT)?

- No? Well then why does it matter?
- Yes? Mate... get out of here.
